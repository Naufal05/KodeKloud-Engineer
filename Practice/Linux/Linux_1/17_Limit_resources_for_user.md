On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuseruser is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:

a. soft limit = 1027

b. hard_limit = 2025



SOLUTION

1. ssh into the Storage server: ssh natasha@172.16.238.15

2. Edit the system limits configuration file: 
    
    sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf

3.  nfsuser soft nproc 1027 
    nfsuser hard nproc 2025

4. to check the changes:

    - sudo su -c "su -c 'ulimit -Hu' -s /bin/sh nfsuser" 

    output : 2026


NOTES:
In the context of Linux system limits, nproc stands for:

âœ… Number of Processes
It defines the maximum number of processes (tasks) that a particular user can create.

This is a per-user limit.

Why is nproc important?
Prevents a single user from creating too many processes and exhausting system resources (fork bomb protection).

Ensures fair resource allocation on multi-user systems.

--------------------------------------------------
On Linux, system limits (like maximum open files, processes, etc.) are configured through several files depending on what limit you are looking for.

âœ… 1. Main System Limits Configuration File
- /etc/security/limits.conf
cat /etc/security/limits.conf


On Linux, system limits (like maximum open files, processes, etc.) are configured through several files depending on what limit you are looking for.

âœ… 1. Main System Limits Configuration File
The primary configuration file is:

bash
Copy
Edit
/etc/security/limits.conf
Defines per-user and per-group resource limits.

Common limits set here include nofile (open files), nproc (processes), etc.

You can check it with:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat /etc/security/limits.conf
âœ… 2. Additional Configuration Directory
In addition, limits may also be set in:

swift
Copy
Edit
/etc/security/limits.d/
This directory contains .conf files where system administrators can define custom limits without modifying the main limits.conf.

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls /etc/security/limits.d/
âœ… 3. PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) Integration
For these limits to take effect, the PAM configuration file usually references them:

bash
Copy
Edit
/etc/pam.d/common-session
/etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive
Look for a line:

swift
Copy
Edit
session required pam_limits.so
âœ… 4. System-Wide (Kernel) Limits
For kernel-level limits, check:

bash
Copy
Edit
/etc/systemd/system.conf
/etc/systemd/user.conf
These files include directives like:

makefile
Copy
Edit
DefaultLimitNOFILE=
DefaultLimitNPROC=
âœ… 5. Temporary (Runtime) Limits
You can check current limits with:

bash
Copy
Edit
ulimit -a
These limits are session-based and not persistent.

ðŸ’¡ Summary:

1. Persistent per-user limits â†’ /etc/security/limits.conf and /etc/security/limits.d/

2. Systemd service limits â†’ /etc/systemd/system.conf

3. Runtime limits â†’ use ulimit -a

ðŸ‘‰ Do you also want me to show how to verify which limits are currently applied to a user or service?
