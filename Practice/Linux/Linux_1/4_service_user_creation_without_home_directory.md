In response to the latest tool implementation at xFusionCorp Industries, the system admins require the creation of a service user account. Here are the specifics:

Create a user named mark in App Server 1 without a home directory.

Soltuion
----------
1. ssh to server
2. sudo useradd --no-create-home mark
3. grep "mark:" /etc/passwd


Creating a user without a home directory using:


**sudo useradd --no-create-home anita**
is commonly done in real-world scenarios where:

âœ… The user doesn't need a personal workspace
A home directory is typically used to store a user's personal files, settings (~/.bashrc, ~/Documents, etc.). But in many cases, that's not needed.

**ðŸ”§ Real-life Use Cases**
1. Service or System Accounts
When creating users to run background services like:

nginx, mysql, jenkins, docker, etc.

These users donâ€™t need home directories because:

They donâ€™t log in interactively

They only run specific services

âœ… Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo useradd --no-create-home --system jenkins
2. Automation or Job-Only Users
Sometimes we create users that are only meant to run automated scripts or cron jobs, and we donâ€™t want to:

Waste space on unnecessary home folders

Allow login or shell access

âœ… Example: A user just to run nightly backup:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin backupuser
3. SFTP-Only Users With Chroot Jail
For users restricted to SFTP uploads/downloads, we might not want them to have traditional home directories or shell access.

âœ… Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin uploaduser
Theyâ€™ll be jailed to a specific folder (e.g., /data/uploads) instead.

ðŸš« Why Avoid Creating Home Directory?
Security: Limits file access and prevents login

Simplicity: No user config files needed

Space-saving: Especially useful in containers or minimal systems

âœ… Summary
Use Case	Why --no-create-home is useful
Service accounts	They donâ€™t need login or personal files
Automation users	They only run scripts; no shell or config needed
SFTP-only users	Files are stored elsewhere; no interactive shell
Security	Reduces potential login paths and data exposure
