In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 1 within the Stratos Datacenter.



Your task is to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 1. Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.


Solution:
ssh into the App Server 1: ssh tony@172.16.238.10

Check files: cd /tmp

Change permissions: sudo chmod +rx xfusioncorp.sh

chmod: The command used to change file permissions.
+rx: The + sign grants the specified permissions, and r and x represent read and execute permissions, respectively. By using +rx, you are granting both read and execute permissions to the file.
file_name: The name of the file you want to modify the permissions for.
Note: To make a file executable, it must also be readable.

Check the result: ls -l xfusioncorp.sh

In this case, the owner has read and execute permissions, while the group and other users have read and execute permissions as well. This means that all users (owner, group, and others) can read and execute the file.

/tmp :
--------

The /tmp directory in Linux/Unix systems is used as a temporary storage location for files that are needed only for a short period of time.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points about /tmp:
Temporary Files â€“ Applications and users store temporary files here during program execution or installations.

Accessible to All Users â€“ All users can write to /tmp, but each file is usually protected by file permissions.

Automatically Cleaned â€“ Many Linux distributions automatically clear /tmp:

On reboot (commonly).

After files have not been accessed for a certain period (configured by system policies).

No Need for Manual Cleanup â€“ The system manages it, but you can manually remove files if needed.

Mount Options â€“ Often mounted with special options (like noexec, nodev) for security.

âœ… Example Uses
Programs like browsers (Chrome, Firefox) store cache files here temporarily.

During software installation, temporary installation files may be placed in /tmp.

When you extract a .tar.gz or create temporary sockets, they may reside in /tmp.

ðŸ’¡ In short: /tmp is a scratchpad area for temporary data that doesn't need to persist.
